            High in the icy peaks of the Himalayas, a hidden monastery gave rise
            to seven legendary snow monkey monks — the Shaolin Snow Monks. Each
            one has mastered a sacred path: martial arts, wisdom, alchemy,
            nourishment, laughter, meditation, and knowledge. Together, they
            protect the ancient scrolls of balance, humor, and decentralized
            enlightenment.

            The Shaolin Snow Monks are more than lore — they are a meme coin
            movement. Our mission is to blend mythology, memes, and money into
            one epic community. By channeling the spirit of the Seven Masters,
            we unite holders around:

            A monastery, carved from ice and stone, hidden beyond blizzards and

          <p className="text-base mb-4">Years passed in peace atop the Himalayas. The Seven had grown into legends—each refining his sacred art under the silent gaze of the snowy peaks. But silence never lasts forever.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">One winter, as the auroras danced crimson across the sky, an old scroll resurfaced from the monastery’s frozen crypt:</p>
          <p className="text-base italic text-white/80 mb-6">“When the great Chain fractures and the world forgets the Way, seven flames must descend from the mountain.”</p>

            <li>Markets were volatile.</li>
            <li>Wisdom was ignored.</li>

            <li><b>📜 Wuko</b> became a whisper on encrypted chat servers, sending poetic market insights that would predict black swan events. People began calling him “the Oracle of Cold.”</li>
            <li><b>🧪 Jin</b> embedded his alchemical formulas into smart contracts—creating the first self-adjusting yield elixirs coded with snowflake logic: no two transactions ever the same.</li>
            <li><b>🍜 Chimi</b> opened a virtual soup kitchen in the metaverse—free meals for the rug-pulled and the hopeful alike. His broth? Soul-healing +2% reflection tax utility.</li>
            <li><b>😂 Yulo</b> hacked billboard ads with haiku memes and laughter spells. He launched the world’s first ZenMeme Protocol—turning humor into governance.</li>
            <li><b>🧘‍♂️ Soma</b> sat in digital meditation in a live 24/7 stream watched by thousands. The stillness somehow stabilized degen behavior. His stillness pool became a staking mechanic with zero impermanent loss.</li>

          <p className="text-base mb-4">It began with a flicker.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">The Eternal Flame — a small, blue flame burning within the heart of the monastery for over a thousand years — vanished.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">No smoke. No ember. Just silence.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">This flame was no ordinary fire. It was said to be the spark of wisdom left behind by the First Monk, who tamed the chaos of the ancient world and sealed greed behind the Ice Gate. Without it, the monastery’s protection weakens, and the balance between insight and impulse begins to tilt.</p>
          <p className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-2">🧙‍♂️ THE SUMMONING OF THE SEVEN</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">A sacred scroll unraveled itself before the altar, its ink still warm:</p>
          <p className="text-base italic text-white/80 mb-6">“The fire is not gone. It is lost. Scattered across realms — frozen in trials, guarded by illusion, buried in code.”</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">The seven masters knew: to restore the flame, each would face a trial tailored to their deepest strength… and darkest flaw.</p>
          <p className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-2">🔥 THEIR TRIALS</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-2"><b>💥 Hanzo, The Flame Trial</b><br/>He faced a mountain of mirrors, each showing a version of himself: arrogant, violent, overconfident. He had to fight not with fists, but restraint. Only when he bowed to his own reflection did the fire fragment appear.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-2"><b>🌀 Wuko, The Paradox Trial</b><br/>In a blizzard that whispered riddles, Wuko had to answer a single question:</p>
          <p className="text-base italic text-white/80 mb-2">“What is the sound of wisdom when no one listens?”</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-2">He sat for days. His answer?<br/><b>“Stillness.”</b><br/>The winds stilled, and the flame fragment floated into his hands.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-2"><b>🌿 Jin, The Alchemy Trial</b><br/>Jin was led into a labyrinth where every potion he brewed had a price. Heal one, harm another. Grow a coin, lose a memory. Only when he brewed nothing — and accepted the power of emptiness — did the flame appear.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-2"><b>🍜 Chimi, The Hunger Trial</b><br/>In a kitchen of illusion, everything he cooked vanished before reaching those in need. Starving villagers begged, cried, blamed. He wept, then cooked again. And again. Until his sincerity broke the spell. The fire was found in the empty pot.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-2"><b>🎭 Yulo, The Echo Trial</b><br/>His jokes turned cruel. His memes mocked instead of healed. A world of laughing shadows surrounded him. He found the flame only when he made the shadows laugh with him, not at others.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-2"><b>🧘‍♂️ Soma, The Depth Trial</b><br/>In a frozen lake, he sank deeper with every breath. His mind screamed to move, to flee, to panic. But he didn’t. At the bottom, still as stone, the flame flickered inside his chest.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-2"><b>📖 Nari, The Memory Trial</b><br/>He stood before the Ice Gate of Time, offered a single key — but warned: “One page forgotten for one step forward.”<br/>He stepped through, forgetting his name, his past… until he emerged with the flame, and was greeted by the other six who remembered him fully.</p>
          <p className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-2">🔥 REIGNITION</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">One by one, the monks returned to the monastery, each placing their recovered fragment into the stone brazier. The Eternal Flame roared back — brighter, hotter, and now surrounded by a corona of radiant snowflakes.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">It was reborn not as a secret… but as a beacon.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">The Monks now knew: The world below had to be warmed. With flame, with frost, with clarity.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">They lit the signal.</p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">Good would fall like snow. Wisdom would blaze like fire. And <b>$MONK</b> would be their flame in the digital dark.</p>
